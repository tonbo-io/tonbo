# RFC: Storage Layout & Filesystem Hierarchy

- Status: Draft
- Authors: Tonbo team
- Created: 2025-10-21
- Area: Storage, WAL, Recovery

## Summary

Define the on-disk directory hierarchy for a Tonbo database instance so that write-ahead logging, future SSTables, and catalog metadata share a consistent root. The layout is expressed in terms of `fusio::path::Path` so it maps across local filesystems, remote object stores, or any custom `DynFs` implementation.

## Goals

- Provide a stable directory/filename schema that `DB` can rely on during initialization and recovery.
- Ensure WAL recovery happens automatically when the DB is pointed at an existing root.
- Reserve locations for forthcoming SSTables, manifests, and mutable spill checkpoints so later features do not churn path semantics.

## Non-goals

- Implement the SSTable layer or manifest format.
- Commit to specific retention policies or compaction strategies.
- Encode tenant/multi-DB topologies (caller chooses the root path).

## Layout Overview

Given a database root `root: Arc<Path>`, Tonbo will create and manage the following subpaths:

```
root/
  wal/
    wal-<seq>.wal          // monotonic start sequence per segment
    state.json                // optional small manifest: last_seq, last_commit_ts
  sst/
    L0/                       // reserved for future levelled SST layout
    staging/                  // scratch for builds/compactions
  manifest/
    ...                       // managed by fusio-manifest
  mutable/
    spill/                    // optional spill files/checkpoints (future)
```

All paths are created through `fusio` APIs; the layout makes no assumptions about POSIX semantics beyond directory hierarchy support.

### WAL directory (`root.join("wal")`)

- **Segments**: `wal-<start_seq>.wal`, where `<start_seq>` is the first frame sequence stored in the file (zero-padded decimal). The writer rotates files at the configured size/time threshold.
- **State file**: `state.json` (small JSON blob) records `last_segment_seq` (highest fully sealed segment start sequence), `last_frame_seq` (highest frame sequence emitted), and `last_commit_ts` (highest MVCC commit timestamp observed). This file is optional during MVP but reserved so WAL rotation, retention, and recovery can avoid scanning all segments when metadata is reliable.
- `wal::WalStorage::ensure_dir` creates the directory and the state file stub as needed.

### SST directory (`root.join("sst")`)

- Placeholder for immutable runs once SSTables land. Subdirectories `L0/` (ingest), `L1/`..`Ln/` (compacted levels), and `staging/` (writer scratch) keep compaction bookkeeping localized. The RFC reserves the names; concrete formats arrive in future SST RFCs.

### Manifest directory (`root.join("manifest")`)

- Reserved exclusively for the `fusio-manifest` subsystem. Tonbo ensures the directory exists but treats its contents as opaque; file naming, versioning, and durability semantics are defined by `fusio-manifest`. When the manifest layer is wired in, Tonbo components will call into that crate for catalog reads/writes instead of manipulating files directly.

### Mutable spill directory (`root.join("mutable")`)

- Reserved for optional spill files, checkpoints, or crash diagnostics. Empty today; keeping the namespace avoids future path churn.

## DB Initialization Flow

When a caller constructs a DB with `DB::new_dyn_with_root(schema, extractor, executor, root: Arc<Path>, cfg: WalConfig)`, the following steps occur:

1. Build a `DbPaths` helper that resolves the four subdirectories using `root.join("wal")`, `root.join("sst")`, etc.
2. Call `WalStorage::ensure_dir(&paths.wal)` to create the WAL directory and associated state file if missing.
3. If any WAL segments exist (`WalStorage::list_segments` TBD), build a `DynModeConfig` and invoke `DB::recover_with_wal(config, executor, cfg.clone()).await` before enabling live ingest. The recovery routine updates `commit_clock` from either the state file or replayed events.
4. Ensure `sst/`, `manifest/`, and `mutable/` directories exist (no-op today).

The same flow applies to typed modes once they return; only the ingest adapter changes.

## Recovery Notes

- During recovery, `Replayer::scan` enumerates segments under `wal/` in lexical order (`wal-0000000001.wal`, ...). If `state.json` is present and trusted, it provides the last durable frame/commit metadata; otherwise, replay scans until the first invalid frame per RFC 0002.
- After replay completes, `commit_clock` is set to `last_commit_ts + 1` so new ingests pick up the correct MVCC timestamp sequence.
- Future work: once the manifest exists, recovery will first consult the latest `manifest/v*.json` to determine which SSTs are durable and how far the WAL can be truncated.

## Open Questions

- Should `state.json` be optional or required for fast start? (Likely optional at MVP; we can gate pruning on its presence.)
- Do we create `mutable/` eagerly, or lazily when spill features arrive? (Leaning lazy creation to avoid empty directories.)
- How do we guarantee atomic updates to `state.json` across backends lacking rename? (Fusio adapters must document the durability guarantees; we may adopt write-then-rename semantics on POSIX.)

## Next Steps

- Implement `DbPaths` helper in code and update constructors to accept `root: Arc<Path>` alongside `WalConfig`.
- Update `WalStorage::ensure_dir` to create `state.json` and expose helpers for listing existing segments.
- Extend `DB::recover_with_wal` to leverage the state file once available.
- Document operational guidance in AGENTS.md after the hierarchy lands in code.
